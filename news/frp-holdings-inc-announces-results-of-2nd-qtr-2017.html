	FRP HOLDINGS, INC./NEWS</h3>

	Chief Financial Officer 904/858-9100</p>
<p>
	<br />
	FRP HOLDINGS, INC. (NASDAQ: FRPH) ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017<br />
	Jacksonville, Fla., Aug. 03, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FRP Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ-FRPH)</p>
<h4>
	Second Quarter Consolidated Results of Operations.</h4>
<p>
	Net income for the second quarter of 2017 was $1,713,000 or $.17 per share versus $774,000 or $.08 per share in the same period last year. The increase is a result of a $2,000,000 environmental remediation expense during the same quarter last year offset by a $620,000 increase this year in equity in loss of joint ventures, primarily as a result of expenses and depreciation during the lease up of Phase I (Dock 79) of RiverFront. Total revenues were $9,360,000, up 1.3%, versus the same period last year. Consolidated total operating profit was up 102.7% as a result of the prior year&rsquo;s $2,000,000 environmental remediation expense.</p>
<h4>
	<br />
	Second Quarter Segment Operating Results.</h4>
<p>
	<strong>Asset Management Segment:</strong><br />
	<br />
	Total revenues in this segment were $7,194,000, up $267,000 or 3.9%, over the same period last year. Net Operating Income (NOI) in this segment for the second quarter was $5,412,000, compared to $5,485,000 in the same period last year, a decrease of 1.3%. That revenue increased while NOI decreased is primarily the result of an increase in reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses. The reimbursable expenses increased revenue without increasing NOI, and the non-reimbursable expenses did nothing for revenue and adversely affected NOI. We ended the second quarter with total occupied square feet of 3,459,473 versus 3,319,891 at the end of the same period last year, an increase of 4.2% or 139,582 square feet. Our overall occupancy rate was 86.8%.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily because of the completion of a 79,550 square foot warehouse at Hollander Business Park in April 2016 and a 103,448 square foot warehouse at Patriot Business Center in April of 2017.</p>
<h4>
	<br />
	Mining Royalty Lands Segment:</h4>
<p>
	Total revenues in this segment were $1,833,000, a decrease of 11%, versus $2,059,000 in the same period last year. This drop is due to $179,000 decrease in royalties at our Manassas, Va. quarry, a $74,000 decrease in royalties at our Tyrone, Ga. location, as well as a $67,000 decrease in royalties at<br />
	our Lake Sand, Fl. location. Royalties are down in Manassas because of Vulcan&rsquo;s mining a portion of the quarry not owned by the Company for two months this quarter. Vulcan should return to our portion for the remainder of the year. Royalties were down in Tyrone compared to last year because of excessive rainfall. As stated last quarter, royalties have fallen off in Lake Sand as a consequence of Vulcan having fully depleted our proven reserves there. Further capital expenditures would be required by our tenant to change their mining plan at Lake Sand and realize more than three million tons of possible reserves, which we do not anticipate any time soon. Total operating profit in this segment was $1,673,000, a decrease of $215,000 versus $1,888,000 in the same period last year.</p>
<h4>
	<br />
	Land Development and Construction Segment:</h4>
<p>
	The Land Development and Construction segment is responsible for (i) seeking out and identifying opportunistic purchases of income producing warehouse/office buildings, and (ii) developing our non-income producing properties into income production.<br />
	With respect to ongoing projects:<br />
	? Our new spec building at Patriot Business Center was placed in service this quarter in April and is currently 49.9% occupied and 83.0% leased. It will be 100% leased and occupied in the third quarter<br />
	? In February, the D.C. Zoning Commission voted 5-0 in favor of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) of Phase II of our RiverFront on the Anacostia project. After formal publishing of the record and a 35 day appeal period we anticipate formal approval in the third quarter of this calendar year<br />
	? We are fully engaged in the formal process of seeking PUD entitlements for our 118 acre tract in Hampstead, Md<br />
	Finally, it has been nearly a year since we placed Dock 79 and its 305 residential units ?in service.? As of June 30, the residential units were 88.20% occupied and 92.46% leased, while retail units remain 80.0% leased with just one space remaining. The project is currently above pro forma in effective rents and leasing absorption with residential stabilization achieved in the third quarter of 2017. However, because of operating losses and depreciation during the lease up of Phase I (Dock 79) of RiverFront on the Anacostia this quarter, equity in loss of joint ventures was $806,000 (including a loss of $10,000 in the Brooksville Joint Venture).</p>
<h4>
	First Six Months Consolidated Results of Operations.</h4>
<p>
	Net income for the first six months of 2017 was $3,156,000 or $.32 per share versus $2,594,000 or $.26 per share in the first six months last year. The increase is a result of a prior year $2,000,000 remediation expense offset by a $1,305,000 increase this year in equity in loss of joint ventures, primarily as a result of expenses and depreciation during the lease up of Phase I (Dock 79) of RiverFront. Total revenues were $18,682,000, down 0.9%, versus the first six months last year. Consolidated total operating profit was up 35%.</p>
<h4>
	First Six Months Segment Operating Results.</h4>
<p>
	<strong><em>Asset Management Segment:</em></strong></p>
<p>
	<br />
	Total revenues in this segment were $14,479,000, down $22,000 or 0.2%, over the first six months last year. The decrease in revenue is primarily due to lower snow removal reimbursements during the first quarter as a result of a milder 2017 winter. Given its nature as a reimbursement, snow removal is largely a pass through expense, and expenses were down a like amount. Net Operating Income in this segment for the first six months of 2017 was $11,101,000, compared to $10,927,000 in the first six months of 2016, an increase of 1.6%.<br />
	Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily because of the purchase of the Gilroy Center in Baltimore County in July of 2016 and the completion of a 79,550 square foot warehouse at Hollander Business Park in April 2016 and a 103,448 square foot warehouse at Patriot Business Center in April of 2017.<br />
	Corporate expense increased due to a first quarter stock option modification expense of $191,000 and increased internal and external audit expense incurred as a result of the conversion from the previous fiscal year (ending September 30) to one that follows the calendar year.<br />
	Mining Royalty Lands Segment:<br />
	Total revenues in this segment were $3,595,000, a decrease of 6.3%, versus $3,837,000 in the first six months last year. This drop is largely due to a $133,000 decrease in royalties at our Manassas, Va. location, a $130,000 decrease at our Tyrone, Ga. location, and a $156,000 decrease in royalties at our Lake Sand, Fl. location. Royalties are down in Manassas because of Vulcan&rsquo;s mining a portion of the quarry not owned by the Company for two months this past quarter. Vulcan should return to our portion for the remainder of the year. Royalties were down in Tyrone compared to last year because of excessive rainfall this past quarter. As stated last quarter, royalties have fallen off in Lake Sand as a consequence of Vulcan having fully depleted our proven reserves there. Further capital expenditures would be required by our tenant to change their mining plan at Lake Sand and realize more than three million tons of possible reserves, which we do not anticipate any time soon. Total operating profit in this segment was $3,232,000, a decrease of $230,000 versus $3,462,000 in the first six months last year.<br />
	Land Development and Construction Segment:<br />
	The Land Development and Construction segment is responsible for (i) seeking out and identifying opportunistic purchases of income producing warehouse/office buildings, and (ii) developing our non-income producing properties into income production.<br />
	With respect to ongoing projects:<br />
	? Our new spec building at Patriot Business Center was placed in service this quarter in April and is currently 49.9% occupied and 83.0% leased. It will be 100% leased and occupied in the third quarter<br />
	? In February, the D.C. Zoning Commission voted 5-0 in favor of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) of Phase II of our RiverFront on the Anacostia project. After formal publishing of the record and a 35 day appeal period we anticipate formal approval in the third quarter of this calendar year<br />
	4<br />
	? We are fully engaged in the formal process of seeking PUD entitlements for our 118 acre tract in Hampstead, Md<br />
	? During the first quarter, we completed construction of the bulkhead at our 664E property on the Anacostia ahead of schedule and under budget.<br />
	Finally, it has been nearly a year since we placed Dock 79 and its 305 residential units ?in service.? As of June 30, the residential units were 88.20% occupied and 92.46% leased, while retail units remain 80.0% leased with just one space remaining. The project is currently above pro forma in effective rents and leasing absorption with residential stabilization achieved in the third quarter of 2017. However, because of operating losses and depreciation during the lease up of Phase I (Dock 79) of RiverFront on the Anacostia this quarter, equity in loss of joint ventures was $1,577,000 (including a loss of $19,000 in the Brooksville Joint Venture).<br />
	Potential REIT Conversion<br />
	Whether through strategic acquisitions, organic growth, joint ventures, or putting our non-income producing land to work, our constant aim is to create and grow shareholder value. To that end, we have for some time explored the possibility of converting this company into a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), with the idea that this may be a more efficient structure given the nature of our business. Though no final decision has been made, in order to have the option to convert to a REIT in 2017, the board has already elected to change from our previous fiscal year (ending September 30), to a fiscal year that follows the calendar year as is required of a REIT. This change went into effect January 1, 2017 and will require one-time additional auditing expenses of $120,000 which will be reflected in 2017. Thus, this past quarter, and every quarter ended June 30 will now be the second quarter of our fiscal year. Finally, consistent with having the option to elect REIT status, we have contributed our mining reserves into a wholly owned subsidiary. Because the parent company still retains control of the land itself, the portion of the mining royalties&rsquo; income that is not attributable to the reserves, but instead more closely resembles ground rents, will be retained by the parent company and will qualify as ?REIT-able? income. The subsidiary will receive only the income attributable to the reserves it now controls. This structure is intended to assure that we will meet the asset and income tests applicable to REITs. These preliminary steps will not have a material impact on our operations if the Company does not elect REIT status.</p>
<h4>
	Summary and Outlook</h4>
<p>
	<br />
	As mentioned last quarter, we were informed by Vulcan Materials Company that Lee County issued Vulcan a Mine Operating Permit (MOP) for our section of their operations in Ft. Myers, the last of the permits required to begin mining this property. This action is the culmination of over twenty years of work to get this property fully entitled and allows Vulcan to begin production immediately. Vulcan has now begun mining at this location. While production in our third quarter will be offset by prepaid royalties, going forward, Vulcan&rsquo;s ability finally to realize the reserves at this site should positively impact revenue and income as it creates an opportunity to collect more than the minimums from this location.<br />
	During the remainder of this year, we expect to reach residential stabilization of Phase I (Dock 79) of RiverFront on the Anacostia and continue pre-development activities for Phase II with the expectation<br />
	that we will break ground in the last quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2018. Our biggest decision this year will be whether or not to convert this company into a Real Estate Investment Trust. As mentioned previously, we have taken steps to ensure that we at least have the option. Any changes in the federal tax code will factor into our analysis of the costs and benefits of REIT status.</p>
<h4>
	<br />
	Subsequent Events</h4>
<p>
	<br />
	The occupancy of the residential units of our Riverfront Holdings I, LLC joint venture exceeded 90% in July 2017. The result of this is that FRP has one year to elect to have the property sold or to cause a ?Conversion?. The ?Conversion? assumes a sales value, calculates the distributions under our agreement with MRP and changes the ownership going forward based on MRP&rsquo;s development incentives. The stabilization and resulting FRP election represent a change in control of the joint venture from MRP to FRP. Accordingly, under the accounting rules FRP will be considered the primary beneficiary of this joint venture and we will consolidate the results of the joint venture at current fair value in our financial statements effective July 2017. This consolidation will have a material impact on our financial statements.<br />
